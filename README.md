# F1 Race Performance Analysis (2021–2024)

This project analyzes the relationship between **qualifying positions** and **final race results** in Formula 1 seasons (2021–2024).  

It explores what are factors, also why & how influence drivers' performance。

The next step I will build predictive models to forecast race outcomes.

## Project Overview

**Data Sources:**  
- [Kaggle Formula 1 Dataset (2021–2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
Includes data on races, results, qualifying sessions, drivers, constructors, and status codes.

---

## Methods & Techniques

- **Data Processing:** Merged multiple CSV files (races, results, drivers, constructors, qualifying) using `pandas`
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized correlations and trends using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

---

## Key Findings

- Strong positive correlation between qualifying position and race finish position   
- The analysis provides insights into how qualifying rank, circuit type, and weather conditions  shape race outcomes  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub
